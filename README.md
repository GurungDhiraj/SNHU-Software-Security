# SNHU-Software-Security

<ins>**Course Description:**<ins>

Through the analysis of advanced security concepts, students will learn how to develop secure code that complies with security testing protocols. In addition to exploring and implementing security concepts through code, students will also learn why and how to apply encryption technologies and techniques to communicate securely.

<ins>**Course Competencies:**<ins>

This course covers the following competencies, which represent the knowledge and skills relevant to your field:

*•	CS-30412: Analyze how advanced security concepts are applied to develop secure code
*•	CS-30413: Design and implement code that complies with software security testing protocols
*•	CS-40414: Write secure communications through the application of current encryption technologies and techniques

Markup : *•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
        *o	Artemis Financial are a financial consulting company that helps their customers with creating a personalized financial plan. They were looking to modernize their infrastructure by trying to enhance and upgrade their security. Specifically, I needed to analyze their existing software for any vulnerabilities and add a checksum verification.

•	What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
      
      o	One thing I did when I found the vulnerabilities was read the vulnerability assessment reports. I used the information in the reports to help me figure out ways to resolve the issues. One of the easiest ways to resolve the vulnerabilities was just updating and using the latest version of the software. It is important to code securely so that you aren’t exposed to known hacking attacks like the common SQL injection attacks. Additionally, coding securely from the start will make it easier to troubleshoot and maintain a high level of security throughout your program. Having a high level of software security will mean that customer information will be better protected and that can lead to more trust in the company.

•	Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  o	Reading all the different vulnerabilities and identifying the false vulnerabilities was the most challenging for me. There were a lot of vulnerabilities to comb through, and it was not always obvious to me if something was a false vulnerability or not. However, at the same time,e going through the real dependency report helped me to become familiar with the format of the report and gain experience on how I should troubleshoot vulnerabilities.

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  o	I increased layers of security by suppressing false vulnerabilities, updating software, and using secure coding methods. In the future, I would use a mixture of the dependency report and a manual code review to identify and fix vulnerabilities. 

•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities? 
  o	I made certain that the software application was functional and secure through a few different methods. One method I used was to run the code multiple times to see if the compiler flagged any issues and resolve them as they came. I also tried to use the proper coding syntaxes and principles. After refactoring the code I ran the code again to ensure that it was functional and also checked the dependency report to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were found.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  o	I will likely refer back to the OWASP documents that has the code for updating the pom.xml files and finding false positives in the vulnerability reports. I will also try to be mindful of my coding syntax and try to use secure coding syntax whenever possible like using proper input validation.

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  o	I would show them the code that enabled me to both encrypt messages and post the data to the site through https protocol.
